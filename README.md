# Swine-Flu-Prediction-Using-AI-ML
This project is a web application built using Streamlit for predicting swine flu based on symptoms provided by the user and for detecting swine flu from X-ray images.

Description
Swine flu, also known as H1N1 influenza, is a respiratory illness caused by the H1N1 influenza virus. This application aims to provide information about swine flu, its causes, symptoms, effects, and history. Additionally, it allows users to input their symptoms and get a prediction on whether they might have swine flu. Moreover, users can upload X-ray images to detect swine flu from the images.

Features
Symptom-based Prediction: Users can input their symptoms through a user-friendly form and get an instant prediction on whether they might have swine flu.
X-ray Image Detection: Users can upload X-ray images, and the application will analyze them to detect the presence of swine flu.
Informative Content: The application provides comprehensive information about swine flu, including its description, causes, effects, and history, to educate users about the disease.
