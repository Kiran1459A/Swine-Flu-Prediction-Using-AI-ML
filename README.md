# Swine-Flu-Prediction-Using-AI-ML
Description
This project is a web application built using Streamlit for predicting swine flu based on symptoms provided by the user and for detecting swine flu from X-ray images.

Features
Symptom-based Prediction: Users can input their symptoms through a user-friendly form and get an instant prediction on whether they might have swine flu.
X-ray Image Detection: Users can upload X-ray images, and the application will analyze them to detect the presence of swine flu.
Informative Content: The application provides comprehensive information about swine flu, including its description, causes, effects, and history, to educate users about the disease.
